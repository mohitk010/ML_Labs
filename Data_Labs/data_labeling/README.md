For Lab 3, I have done snorkel lab 1, these are the changes I made to the file:

1. Added 1 new SPAM LF, which classifies a comment as SPAM if a link(URL) is detected
2. Added 1 new HAM LF, which classfies a comment as HAM if words like "Beautiful" or "Cute" are detected.
3. Used 2 new classifiers instead of the Logistic Regression, I used Linear SVM and Calibrated Classifier
